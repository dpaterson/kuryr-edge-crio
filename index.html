Overview

# Overview

The focus of our work is a forward thinking conceptual architecture
for deploying containerized workloads at the edge leveraging OpenStack IaaS.

## What we'll cover:
1. Physical environment
2. Distributed compute nodes
3. Simulated network impairment
4. Network Topology
5. Kuryr overview
6. CRI-O overview
7. Looking forward: Kuryr integration and bare metal at the edge
8. Closing remarks and Q&A

---
# Motivation

* Supporting workloads at the edge is becoming mission critical:

--
 * Lower latency

--
 * Reduction of backhaul

--
 * 5G, MEC, and IoT have many usecases where proximity is clutch

--
* Containers, in particular K8S currently, is the prefered model for deploying
and managing cloud native applications.

--
* Kuryr - Has a Container Networking Interface (CNI) plugin that enables containers
to utilize the Neutron networking abstraction.
 * Seperates concerns, OpenStack provides physical hardware abstraction (IaaS)
and K8S is concerned with micro service orchestration.
 * Ideally K8S is just a workload in terms of infrastructure and should be
 managed like any other workload in OpenStack.
  Double ideally - we don't really care if K8S is running in VMs or on bare-
  metal instances.

---
# Phased Implementation Strategy

1. Rack & stack hardware and configure physical networking
2. Deploy typical 9 node cluster representing CDC
3. Configure network impairment node
4. Discover and provision remote compute nodes
5. Instantiate instance running simple workload on remote compute
6. Network impairment testing
7. Kuryr integration at edge site
8. Deploy Ironic at edge site to support bare metal instances
9. Close the loop, make it all work together

We are currently working on 7 - 9

Openstack Activity on the Edge

---
# State of OpenStack's support for the edge
There's a lot of activity and also a long way to go:

* OpenStack's support for the edge (near, middle, far, fog ...) is still in a
relatively early stage.

--
* The OpenStack Edge Working Group is doing good work defining use cases and
MVP architectures

  assets/800px-Centralized_Control.png)]]
</td></tr>
</table>

---
Our prototype closely resembles the OSF Edge Computing Workgroup's Centralized
Control Plane MVP architecture, sans Cinder

---
Openstack, Linux Foundation, and other edge related projects
* There are many nascent satellite projects addressing requirements needed for
OpenStack to support the edge

--
 * StarlingX
 * Akraino
 * Airship
 * OPNFV
 * LF EDGE umbrella project
 * ONAP
 * Next week there will be more!

---
# Why it's good?
* The demand for IaaS at the edge is really good for OpenStack
* There is a lot of momentum around edge in the open source community
* These projects are driving OpenStack to be ahead of the curve

---
# Why it's bad?
* Confusion! It's difficult to track what project is doing what...
* Having many projects with overlapping/redundant concerns makes adoption
difficult
* Fragmentation and duplication of efforts, 15 code bases instead of 1

---
template: section_layout

So what can we do right now?

---
# What can we do with OpenStack at the edge right now?

OpenStack already has features we can utilize to:
* Provision edge compute nodes
* Deploy workloads at the edge

---
# Approach to Networking
While there are many permutations of how networking a remote compute site, the
following patterns seem to make the most sense:
* Use L3 vs L2 where possible
* Workloads should use a provider network that is only utilized by the remote
compute site
* Don't rely on CDC for workload DHCP, instead:
  * User config_data model for injecting addresses into instances during
  instance boot time (cloud-init)
  * Use site-local DHCP
* Prototyping in a single lab requires some kind of network impairment testing
in order to gauge real-world performace.
* Provisioning remote compute nodes over L3 works, cool!

Leverage existing features:
* Nova Host Aggregates and Availability Zones (AZ)
* Roles, flavors and supporting metadata.
* Neutron/OVS composible networks

---
# Workloads running in bare-metal instances - where we are headed
.center[.eighty[![Prototype Topology](

Ideally we'll be able to run K8S on on bare-metal instances, with the Kuryr CNI
plugin providing container networking through Neutron.

Limitations

---
# Limitations for remote compute nodes

* Control plane communication latency

--
 * Bad things start happening when round-trip time (RTT) exceeds 100ms

--
* Compute and networking only explored thus far
 * Ephemeral storage only

--
* If the link to the control plane goes down workloads will continue to run but
that's about it until connectivity to control plan is restored

---
template: section_layout

Network Impairment

---
# Simulated Network Impairment
To simulate real world latency between the control plane and remote compute
site some kind of simulated network impairment is needed.

* Ideally all L3 traffic goes through impairment device
* If you are doing any L2 networking (VLAN) testing may have to happen
directly on controller nodes
* Pretty simple to implement
 * Routing
 * Simple bash scripts that control latency

CRI-O

---
# CRI-O

.center[.seventy[![Insert graphic here](assets/criologo.svg)]]

---

# CRI-O

## What's CRI-O?

* More  ways to run containers than just the docker tool.
  * runc, rkt, frakti, cri-containerd and more.
  * Follow the OCI standard defining how the runtimes start and run containers
  * Lack a standard way of interfacing with an orchestrator
--

* Standard API to be able to talk to and manage a container runtime.
  * This API is called the **Container Runtime Interface (CRI)**
--

* Since 2018 CRI-O is an official part of the Kubernetes family of tools.

---

# CRI-O

## Why CRI-O?

* **Open Source Project**
  * Contributors from several companies, such as Red Hat, SUSE, Intel, Google, IBM...
--

* **Secure**
  * In Docker, every container is a 'child' of the large Docker Daemon
--

  * CRI-O containers are children of the process that spawned it
--

* **Lightweight**
--

* **Official Kubernetes Project**

---

# CRI-O

## Podman and Buildah

#.left-column[![Insert graphic here](assets/podman.svg)]

--

#.right-column[![Insert graphic here](assets/buildah.png)]

---

# CRI-O

## Podman and Buildah

* **Buildah**
  * Allows you to have a Kubernetes cluster without any Docker daemon for both runtime and builds
  * Specializes in building OCI images
  * Buildah's commands replicate all of the commands that are found in a Dockerfile
--

* **Podman**
  * Podman specializes in all of the commands and functions to maintain and modify those OCI container images
  * Uses Buildah's build functionality under the covers to create a container image
  * You can just alias podman for docker on your machine

Next Steps

---
# Next steps

* Complete Kuryr integration at edge
 * Octavia is currently a Kuryr requirement
   * Octavia is a heavy lift for DCN, alternatives?
* Deploy Ironic at edge to support bare metal instances for hosting K8S
* Use config-data for edge instances, VMs and BM
 * Allows for IP injection etc
* Completion around Train/Shanghai time frame
